\abstract
Distributed database systems in the Blockchain are an emerging technology aiming to provide users with the required tools to perform tasks and computations without an intermediate entity, to build self-trust systems where the rules are agreed upon beforehand and set the basis for a universal ecosystem. Users can then interact democratically and ensure that the committed transactions will be immutable truthful, confident, and non-reTpudiable.
The most famous case of a worldwide distributed blockchain system is Bitcoin. 

By the time this work is written, bitcoin had demonstrated robustness, reliability, and proof that new ways of trust/collaboration can be built on the Internet over 14 years (since its implementation in 2019) to remediate the economic boundaries that banks are still unable to solve.

To enable a self trusted system, the Bitcoin standard implemented in its technology a proto-scripting language where all participants agree upon a set of base rules such as:
A maximum capital of 21,000,000 bitcoins will ever exist.
During the first 210,000 blocks, each block produced 50 bitcoins (approximately every 10 minutes).
After the first 210,000 blocks, the number of Bitcoins generated will halve to 25 bitcoins (the number keeps halving approximately every four years), with the last Bitcoin generated somewhere in 2140.
This new economic agreement aims to generate a deflationary economy. The currency's value will likely increase over time (emulating scarce resources). 
The proto scripting language generated two concepts of ecnomic tokenization and usability:

Many projects are emerging from the original idea of Blockchain, specially created to remediate the economic boundaries that banks are still unable to solve. New standards for code as a "proof of trust" created the possibility to develop and compile source code in the blockchain (better known as smart contracts). 

 however, little has been researched so far for its application in the industry, where supply chain and

Industries can nowadays benefit from blockchain systems to record and track data in more trustful ways and allow cooperation. However, the problem of privacy, ownership, and security emerges when trying to implement such systems. In this thesis project, a schema and system design is proposed to record unique ownership of certain assets in the blockchain (datasets ownership) and provide the infrastructure to allow its usage or deny it depending on the agreements of the system through the issuance of NFT's for specific datasets.
